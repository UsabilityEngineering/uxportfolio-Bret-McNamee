The embedded home button on web pages
Bret McNamee Feb 20, 2020

The interaction that I will be talking about today has to do with web pages, and how many of them have an embedded home button on every page. The pictures will help to describe what I am talking about in detail, but the premise is that the top left of every web page the site has their logo. When that logo is clicked on it will return you to their home page.  Now, there aren't any specific documents that say clicking on the icon will return you to the home page, but many web pages have adopted it because many users are used to that kind of interaction.  This interaction is both learnable, and memorable. The **learnable** side of it comes from when you hover over it the cursor, with most websites, turns into a different style so it shows you that there is something to click on, which encourages users to click on it and find out what happens. The **memorable** part of it comes from the fact that it’s not just any one website that has this option, but many websites all across the internet have this option even if the websites have no relation to each other. This also provides a lot of **efficiency** by not having to look across the menu bar for the “home” tab, or whatever that website decides to call it. The user can just go to the upper left of any web page and click on the sites logo to return to the home page. The only downside to this, as previously mentioned, is that there isn’t anything on the site to tell you that clicking the logo returns you to the home page, even though many websites have that option. It may be hard for a new user to learn of that concept on their own, they will most likely have to be told that they are able to do that.
