Hi there, my name is Bret McNamee. Below is a picture of me.

I am a Computer Science major, and am taking this class because the job that I will start when I graduate at the end of this semester is a Business Analyst job. In this job I will interact with non-tech people that I will need to be able to communicate with and ensure that the interfaces that I am creating for them is user friendly enough.
